# LangMF
Script language for Windows (written on Visual Basic 6.0)
---
The LangMF programming language is based on the VBScript script engine (you can also use JavaScript, Chakra, VB.NET, C#), it has great flexibility, easy automation with office and other programs, good speed (for ultra-fast operations connected DLL libraries are used or ASM code!), A huge amount of built-in features for any tasks, working with any programming language and full control over it, the source code compilation function, creating autonomous EXE files (WinXP - Win10) and much more.
